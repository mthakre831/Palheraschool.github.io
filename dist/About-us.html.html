    <u>
        <li>A village school is held in a small building. It has hardly more than two or three rooms. Sometimes it has only one big room, under shady trees. The boys sit on ‘mats’ and sometimes on the bare ground under shady trees. There are only one or two teachers who teach all the four or five infant classes.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>The students generally belong to poor families. They are very poorly dressed. They are generally dirty and bare-footed. Their noses are often found running and they seldom wash themselves. In the school there are no arrangements for bathing and washing.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>The village school master is an important man in the village. His word is law for the villagers. He is a teacher, post master, doctor and judge. He is low paid. He is simple in habits and dress. He is harsh and strict towards his students. They are terribly afraid of him.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>The villagers have implicit faith in him. They supply him most of his needs. He is contented with his lot and wishes for nothing better. He is proud of his position in the village and sometimes gives himself airs.</li>
